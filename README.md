I am __Nitin__, a passionate tech enthusiast and a Computer Science student at the University of Southern California. Throughout my journey, I have had the opportunity to co-author research papers while interning at major institutions such as the University of Hyderabad, the University College Dublin, and the University of Calgary. My dedication to academic excellence has resulted in being the university topper and achieving a perfect 10/10 GPA in two semesters.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have actively participated in hackathons and competitions, including leading a team of 6 to win second place at the Smart India Hackathon, securing second place at a TechFest conducted by IITB x Tata Sons, and winning first place in a project judged by professors and industry experts, which enables users to train a model and tweak hyperparameters without writing a single line of code.

I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience to create a meaningful impact in society by solving real-life problems. Please contact me if you think I could be a good fit for your company or would like to chat. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you!
